A birth certificate is an official document issued by the government that records the essential details of a person's birth. It includes information such as the individual's full name, date of birth, place of birth, names of parents, registration number, date of registration, and the issuing authority. Birth certificates play a crucial role in various aspects of life. They serve as primary proof of identity for obtaining important documents like passports and driver's licenses. Additionally, birth certificates establish citizenship and are often required for legal transactions such as marriage and adoption. They also facilitate enrollment in schools, provide evidence for inheritance and property rights, and contribute to genealogical research. Keeping the original birth certificate secure is important, and certified copies can be obtained for official use while preserving the original document.
